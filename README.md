# Checklist Project


The present project offers **Checklists** to control different daily activities. It offers actions such as creating a new list and adding items. In addition, the user can control the checklist by checking, editing, and deleting the items.

The back-end is already done; however, the front-end isn't ready. It is missing to complete. 


##### Back-end


The back-end was developed using 'Java8', 'Maven', 'Model View Control (MVC)', and 'JUnit' with 'Mockito' for testing the control layer. 

> There are two entities: *Checklist* and *Item* with those crud functionalities. Furthermore, the project was developed with *sqlite3* Database.


##### Front-end


The front-end has been developed using 'javaScript', 'html 5', and 'Css3'.
